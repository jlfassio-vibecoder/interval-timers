 * Canonical format contract:
 * - Workout has `exerciseBlocks` (grouped exercises), not legacy `blocks` (flat list).
 * - Each exercise has `reps` as string (AI may return number).
 * - Callers ensure `description` is present where required.
 *
 * Consumers: generate-program-chain, generate-challenge-chain, generate-workout-chain,
 * generate-program, extend-program, admin persistence (programs/challenges/workouts),
 * ProgramBlueprintEditor, WorkoutPlayer, map-program-workout-to-artist.
 *
 * When to use:
 * - normalizeWorkoutForEditor: single workout (e.g. editor init, or one-off normalization).
 * - normalizeProgramSchedule: program or challenge (object with `schedule`: weeks with workouts).
 * - normalizeWorkoutSet: workout set (object with `workouts`: flat array, no weeks).
 * - getExercisesFromWorkout: read-only flatten for display/playback (accepts both formats).
